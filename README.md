# gift-smart
We are trying to solve the problem of knowing what present to buy a friend, family member, or significant other for their birthday or the holidays. We propose a web application that scans a person’s social media activities (recent pins on Pinterests, likes on Facebook) and compiles a database of products that they may like. The application will then search for an approved list of “gift ideas” on Amazon, Groupon, or Etsy to find the affordable price. Pinterest and Facebook both offer APIs that return a [public] user’s recent activity. Amazon and Groupon offer APIs to look up products and prices. The application will include 3rd party authentication from Facebook or Pinterest. The user benefit of this application would be an easy way of purchasing gifts that is still genuine, creative, and thoughtful. It removes the need to scroll through a person’s facebook feed or scan pins on Pinterest but still gives the user the authority to select a direction to go in for the “price-selection” phase
